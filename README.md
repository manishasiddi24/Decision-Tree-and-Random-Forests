# Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forests
Decision Trees split data into branches based on feature conditions, creating simple rules for classification or regression. They are easy to interpret but can overfit if not pruned or depth-limited. Random Forests combine many decision trees, averaging their results to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.Both methods can rank features by importance, showing which variables matter most. Using cross-validation helps ensure the model performs consistently across different data splits. These models are widely used for both predictive accuracy and interpretability.
Procedure for Decision Trees & Random Forests
1. Load and preprocess the dataset â€“ handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale if required.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
3. 3. Train a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize it to understand how the data is split.
4. Tune hyperparameters (e.g., max_depth, min_samples_split) to prevent overfitting.
5. Train a Random Forest Classifier and compare accuracy with the Decision Tree.
6. 6. Analyze feature importances to identify which features contribute most to predictions.
7. Evaluate models using cross-validation to ensure results are consistent and reliable.
