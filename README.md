# Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forests
Decision Trees split data into branches based on feature conditions, creating simple rules for classification or regression. They are easy to interpret but can overfit if not pruned or depth-limited. Random Forests combine many decision trees, averaging their results to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
